SolarNetwork Foundation was established in 2017 to serve as a curator and promoter of the open codebase and data-driven process that comprise the SolarNetwork platform.  The Foundation's work is guided by our belief in:

 1. open source computing
 1. data-driven methodology
 1. open access to data

We celebrate the innovations emerging from the community of developers, enthusiasts, and business leaders who share these values.

Our mission is to protect and preserve the environment by supporting energy education, and to use technology to engage people for the purposes of energy awareness, conservation, and the uptake of renewable energy sources.

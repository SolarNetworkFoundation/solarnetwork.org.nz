SNF realizes that understanding the impact of our energy use on the environment can be difficult. There are many factors that make up your _energy environment_ such as the power you consume, the price you pay for that power, the power you generate, the price you earn for that power, and even the weather. We work to help you make sense of all this with the SolarNetwork computing platform that:

 * **collects** measurable data from your energy environment over time
 * provides simple ways to **query** the collected data and **visualize** the data in understandable ways
 * facilitates the **discovery** of patterns of energy use, to enable actionable changes that support the more efficent use of energy
 * enables **automated** energy management, achieving energy efficiencies with minimal work on your part

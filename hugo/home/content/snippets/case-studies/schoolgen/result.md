SolarNetwork's flexible, customizable platform met these challenges, while providing a low-cost, reliable platform for School-gen's evolving monitoring and visualization needs. Schools are now able to see their generation and consumption as parts of their total energy environment, enabling them to save power and generating new learning opportunities.

The images below show the interactive visualization used at [one School-gen school](http://www.schoolgen.co.nz/schoolgen-schools/otonga-primary-30-kw). Energy generation data is collected from six solar power inverters, and consumption data from a power meter that measures energy drawn from the electricity grid. Energy generated by the solar panels shows up as yellow bars going _up_ from the horizontal axis, while energy consumed from the grid shows up as orange bars going _down_. Sometimes the school actually generates more energy than it needs; when that happens the excess energy is exported onto the grid, making the school an energy producer! Exported energy shows up on the chart as orange bars going _up_ from the horizontal axis.

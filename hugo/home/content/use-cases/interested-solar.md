### It's not always about money

The promise of putting solar panels on your roof to lower your energy bill is a seductive one.  With a minimum of fuss, a solar PV array can quickly be installed on your roof and start pumping clean energy into your house, offsetting the growing power bill for years and years. Well, that depends. If you are using electricity all day, and the cost of those kilowatt-hours is going up, then to could make a lot of sense economically to add solar PV to your roof. If you don't use power during the day, and the surplus power form the solar array is just feeding the grid - that's a different story. If you are depending on your local retailer of power to buy that surplus - at a good price, for the lifetime of the solar array - maybe you need to data to make this decision.

### Sometimes, it is completely about money

Today, electric transporation is becoming widespread and economically viable. That means that some of the time, you are going to be charging your electric car while it is parked in your garage or driveway. Displacing petrol or diesel fuel with solar power generated right form your roof is possibly one of the best investments you could make.  While we don't know what the price of fossil fuels will be in the future, we can expect it could rise. But even today, the ROI of a solar array once you have an EV makes a lot of sense.

### Watch this space

Get ready for the future where solar PV really makes sense for everyone.  Home and building automation, making switching deciisons based on energy forecasts, time-of-use (TOU) metering and demand response is all coming - especially as the demands of electric vehicles begin to impact the grid.  Be prepared and have your energy dataset all organised and analysed for when that future gets here.

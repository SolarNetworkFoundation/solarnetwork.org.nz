### Get some visibility into your intra-day energy use

Power bills are one way that homes, schools and businesses understand how much energy they are using. But often it is "after the fact" information, displayed as a few numbers on a piece of paper, with some trend information along with it. These are increasingly helpful in their formats, but still limited in their ability to help you understand your energy use. You might ask: "When do I use the most energy?" "What appliance uses the most energy in my building?" "What kind of carbon footprint do I have?" "What does my energy use look like for this week?" "Do I use more energy on rainy days?" "What would a rooftop solar array do to my energy use?"

### Visualise your energy flows

SolarNetwork is a good way for homes and businesses to answer these questions. Available through any web browser, live charts display information about your energy trends and important events such as maximum or minimum energy use. You can overlay local weather information, electricity spot-price information, solar generation to make the dashboard relevant to you. Not only can you measure the whole building's use, but with the right metering setup, you can break down your energy use by function - such as hot water use, lighting, heating and even refrigeration.  The patterns become evident as they develop, in real time, rather than being a surprise at the end of the month when the power bill arrives. 

### Make better energy decisions

Once you have these patterns in front you, you can act informed by real evidence. Here at the SolarNetwork Foundation, we are building a set of best practices and aim to help you with finding the right providers to lower your energy bill, make your energy use more renewable and help you share your story with others.

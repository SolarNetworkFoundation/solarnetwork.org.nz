Power bills are one way that we understand how much energy we are using, but the information they provide is too brief and comes too late to answer many questions about your energy use. You might ask:

 * When do I use the most energy?
 * What appliance uses the most energy in my building?
 * What kind of carbon footprint do I have?
 * What does my energy use look like over a typical week or day?
 * Do I use more energy on rainy days?
 * What would a rooftop solar array do to my energy bill?

SolarNetwork is a great way for homes and businesses to answer these questions and more. The data catpured by SolarNetwork can power web-based live interactive charts of your energy trends. You can overlay local weather information, electricity market information, and solar generation to make the dashboard relevant to you. Not only can you measure your whole building's use, but with the right metering setup you can break down your energy use by function - such as hot water use, lighting, heating, and even refrigeration.  Patterns become evident as they develop, in real time, rather than being a surprise at the end of the month when the power bill arrives.

Once you discover patterns in your energy use, you can make informed decisions based on the evidence. At SolarNetwork Foundation, we can help you lower your energy bill, make better use of renewable energy, and share your experience with others.

The charts below show average seasonal energy production and use at a primary school. Power generation is shown above the horizontal axis, so _higher_ lines represent more power generation. Power consumption is shown below the horizontal axis, so _lower_ lines represent more power consumption. <span style="color: rgb(233, 167, 18); font-weight: 700;">Yellow lines</span> represent summer, <span style="color: rgb(118, 33, 35); font-weight: 700;">burgundy lines</span> autumn, <span style="color: rgb(128, 163, 183); font-weight: 700;">blue lines</span> winter, and <span style="color: rgb(92, 135, 38); font-weight: 700;">green lines</span> spring.

The chart on the left shows average power generation and consumption per day of the week. You can see immediately that this site uses much less power on weekends. The chart on the right shows averages per hour of the day. You can see that in winter far more power is consumed, most of it first thing in morning. This was attributed to electric heating, which used a good deal of energy to warm the building up at the start of each work day.

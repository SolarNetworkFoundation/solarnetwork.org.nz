Power bills are one way that homes, schools, and businesses understand how much energy they are using. This brief summary of information, displayed as a few numbers covering a whole month of past time, is limited in its ability to help you understand your energy use. You might ask:

 * When do I use the most energy?
 * What appliance uses the most energy in my building?
 * What kind of carbon footprint do I have?
 * What does my energy use look like for this week?
 * Do I use more energy on rainy days?
 * What would a rooftop solar array do to my energy bill?

SolarNetwork is a great way for homes and businesses to answer these questions and more. The data catpured by SolarNetwork can power web-based live interactive charts of your energy trends. You can overlay local weather information, electricity market information, and solar generation to make the dashboard relevant to you. Not only can you measure your whole building's use, but with the right metering setup you can break down your energy use by function - such as hot water use, lighting, heating, and even refrigeration.  The patterns become evident as they develop, in real time, rather than being a surprise at the end of the month when the power bill arrives.

Once you have discover patterns in your energy use, you can make informed decisions based on the evidence. Here at SolarNetwork Foundation, we are building a set of best practices and aim to help you find the right energy providers to lower your energy bill, make better use of renewable energy, and share your experience with others.

The chart below shows average seasonal energy production and use for one site. Power generation is shown above the horizontal axis and power concumption below. The <span style="color: rgb(0, 158, 193); font-weight: 700;">yellow lines</span> represent summer, <span style="color: rgb(0, 158, 193); font-weight: 700;">burgundy lines</span> autumn, <span style="color: rgb(0, 158, 193); font-weight: 700;">blue lines</span> winter, and <span style="color: rgb(0, 158, 193); font-weight: 700;">green lines</span> spring.

The chart on the left shows averages per day of the week. You can see immediately that this site uses much less power on weekends. The chart on the right shows averages per hour of the day. You can see that in winter far more power is consumed, most of it first thing in morning. This was attributed to electric heating, which used a good deal of energy to warm the building up at the start of each work day.

Power bills are one way that homes, schools, and businesses understand how much energy they are using. This brief summary of information, displayed as a few numbers covering a whole month of past time, is limited in its ability to help you understand your energy use. You might ask:

 * When do I use the most energy?
 * What appliance uses the most energy in my building?
 * What kind of carbon footprint do I have?
 * What does my energy use look like for this week?
 * Do I use more energy on rainy days?
 * What would a rooftop solar array do to my energy bill?

SolarNetwork is a great way for homes and businesses to answer these questions and more. The data catpured by SolarNetwork can power web-based live interactive charts of your energy trends. You can overlay local weather information, electricity market information, and solar generation to make the dashboard relevant to you. Not only can you measure your whole building's use, but with the right metering setup you can break down your energy use by function - such as hot water use, lighting, heating, and even refrigeration.  The patterns become evident as they develop, in real time, rather than being a surprise at the end of the month when the power bill arrives.

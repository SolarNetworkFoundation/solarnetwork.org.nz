For many edifices, sustainability is something that gets tacked on afterward, a concept retrofitted onto a structure that never really throught about it. That's understandable, given the history of energy and resource management. But today, if you're building a new edifice, it makes a lot of sense to put sustainbility into the design from the very start.

Being able to have live information about how your building is performing, across 4 seasons of the year and over many years lets you make good decisions. But how to choose which efficiency and conservation options are going to be worth it for you? What are the things to plan for now so that the building is ready when those technologies are available from the market at a reasonable price? The evidence is out there - and SolarNetwork is proud to be holding that evidence.

When you build, put measurement down as a must-have in your first design. This way, you can accumulate all the evidence you need to make good decisions. And because the data held in the SolarNetwork platform is made to be compared to other data, you can start seeing not only your own data but how it compares to other projects. That means that you are prepared and agile in being able to react to new market offerings.

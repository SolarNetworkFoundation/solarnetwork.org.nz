### Energy underlies everything in our future

Energy management is becoming a vital part of the way our earth runs. While it certainly is a long journey, we are moving as a society toward more renewable, sustainable economy as the same time as we're growing as a population. Everything we do here onward is going to have an energy component to its design. No longer will energy use for an activity, a product design, a campaign be a secondary afterthought - it will be built into the requirement from the get go. This means that our future engineers, architects, procurement teams and politicians need tools to understand energy flows.

### Build your science curriculum around SolarNetwork

There's no better time than the present to get started on a compelling science curriculum that involves energy data. Students need to have access to the kind of energy and energy planning systems that the future will need. This future is going to be about distruibuted generation, mobile apps, real-time analytics, tight integration with building management systems and appliances. It's going to need tools that supply decision makers with up to the minute optimisation schemes, energy forecasts that take local weather into account and local clean generation of renewable energy from solar and wind.  What a perfect time to start the experiments, put the tools in the hands of your students, and give them the experience of a lifetime.

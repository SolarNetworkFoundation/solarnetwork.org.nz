There is no real rule of thumb as to what energy practices are best for everyone - every edifice is unique. That's because the equipment in each building is different, the schedules by which you use energy are different and custom.  But studying your own energy usage patterns using SolarNetwork should help you develop a strategy for saving money, lowering your carbon footprint, and seeing progress over time.  But the work you've done is worth more than just lowering your own energy costs, it's worth sharing with others!  Let us help you design a custom dashboard, mobile app or learning tool to convey the benefits of your energy policy to the world.

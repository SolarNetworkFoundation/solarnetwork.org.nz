Energy environments vary enormously between people, organisations, and places. Things like the amount of energy used or generated, when energy is used or generated, what energy is used for, and the equipment delivering energy are unique.  Seeing your energy visualised via SolarNetwork will help you develop a strategy for saving money lowering your carbon footprint over time. Sharing your efforts and outcomes with others is an excellent way to then help others learn from _your_ energy story.

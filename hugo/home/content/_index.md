SNF helps individuals and organisations study their energy use and the positive impact renewable energy can yield. SNF provides technology and skills that eanble anyone to broadcast their energy conservation and sustainable strategies for all to learn from. SNF recognizes that understanding one's impact on the environment through their energy use is difficult to achieve. SNF is working to make this easier by building the internet-hosted SolarNetwork computing platform that

 * collects fine-grain data on energy consumption and generation over time
 * provides simple ways to query the collected data and visualize the data in easy to understand ways
 * affords the discovery of patterns of energy use from the data, to enable actionable changes that reduce energy use or use energy more efficiently
 * enables automated energy management so energy reductions or efficiencies can be achieved without people even having to consider what actions to take

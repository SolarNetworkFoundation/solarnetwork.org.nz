Project Litefoot is an award-winning NZ based charity that uses the concept of sports-based competition to inspire kids to become environmental champions.

The Birkenhead Football Club is one of Litefoot's most active and proactive clients. To track electricty use at their club, Litefoot installed a SolarNode along with 2 types of kilowatt-hour meters to measure power use both upstairs and downstairs. Using SolarNetwork's interactive dashboard, SolarConsole, Litefoot now has real visibility into Birkenhead's energy use by load type, and can both chart that data as well as download it to use in spreadsheets or reports. The SolarNode will allow Litefoot to develop a "signature" for power use for the club's refrigeration, lighting, hot water and potentially other circuits as well. This is possible because the SolarNode can tap into the data streams from a variety of single-phase and 3-phase kilowatt-hour meters, and additional meters can be added to capture new information. 

 Once the data is up on SolarNet, a custom dashboard can be created showing their customers the information in the way they want to show it. We expect that the valuable energy efficiency additons that Project Litefoot will be making to the club show up as evidence in the data and the dashboards. So for example, siwtching to LED lighting at Birkenhead could reduce their power bills and improve their carbon footprint at the same time.

The big vision here is to enable the same data collection at a set of "archetypal" clubs across their client base, that possibly use energy in similar ways. By measuring Birkenhead as a pilot flagship club, and solving their energy challenges, Project Litefoot is on their way to making smart energy decisions for sports clubs nationwide.

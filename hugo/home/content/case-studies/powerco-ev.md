PowerCo is one of New Zealand's largest transmission companies, spanning two large regions of the North Island.  They see the huge potential for electric vehicles on their network, and also see renewable distributed generation coming online in a big way, They wanted to combine those two visions in am implementation that showed the public what that clean-energy future might be like.

PowerCo chose SolarNetwork and a SolarNetwork enabled EV charger to display how much energy the unit has provided for customers, and what kind of carbon emissions that represented.  EV charging customers can see the sunshine and know that the energy of the sun right in front of them was going into making their transporation cleaner and more efficient. Customising the energy dashboards with PowerCo allows PowerCo to own the brand and the sales channel to the end user,  this is an important aspect of SolarNetwork design and implementations.

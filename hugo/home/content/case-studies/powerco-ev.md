Powerco needed to create a flagship technology demonstration that not only worked flawlessly as a durable public resource, but had all of their branding as well.  The EV charger needed to be high-tech, supporting the latest charge point protocols for fleet management, real-time metering and remote management of the unit, and the integration a secondary grid-connect solar PV array.  The visible dashboard needed to display real-time data shown via an attractive, responsive touchscreen app.

PowerCo chose SolarNetwork and a SolarNetwork enabled EV charger to display how much energy the unit has provided for customers, and what kind of carbon emissions that represented.  EV charging customers can see the sunshine and know that the energy of the sun right in front of them was going into making their transporation cleaner and more efficient. Customising the energy dashboards with PowerCo allows PowerCo to own the brand and the sales channel to the end user,  this is an important aspect of SolarNetwork design and implementations.

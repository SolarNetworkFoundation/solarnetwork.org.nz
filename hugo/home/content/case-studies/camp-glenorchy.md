{{% section  title="Camp Glenorchy" style="default" lead="Come for the beauty, come away empowered"
%}} [Camp Glenorchy](https://www.campglenorchy.co.nz/) is New Zealand’s first [Net Zero
Energy](https://www.theheadwaters.co.nz/sustainability/energy/net-zero-energy/) accommodation, which
means the site will, on average, generate as much energy as it uses. To achieve this ambitious goal,
visitors that stay here need to be informed of the effects they are having on the local environment
over the course of their stay, so they can help minimize their impact.

Camp Glenorchy goes out of its way to make this as easy as possible for its guests by monitoring
many aspects of every room on the site, such as temperature, humidity, and even if windows are open
or shut. Those measurements drive a sophisticated environment control system that automatically
maximizes energy savings while keeping guests comfortable. Camp Glenorchy also provides a tablet
device for each guest room that shows what the current environment is as well as allowing them to
control things like the room temperature.

Camp Glenorchy needed a way to capture the data coming from the hundreds of sensors deployed
throughout the site, and leverage it in all aspects of its business including the site’s website,
the guest tablet application, internal operational support applications, and supporting the Net Zero
Energy certification process.

Camp Glenorchy deployed SolarNode devices throughout the site to capture all the data into
SolarNetwork. The SolarNetwork API made it easy for Camp Glenorchy to then query the data and
integrate meaningful information into the key aspects of the business.

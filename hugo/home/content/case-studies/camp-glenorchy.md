Camp Glenorchy from the start aimed to be holistically a sustainable but luxurious placed to stay.  Not only did the energy needs for the resort need to be renewable, but water management, procurement of goods and services, building materials, waste treatment and processes to run the campus all needed to demonstrate  best practices.  How to balance these requirements was one challenge, but engineering design company Evident had yet another: how to communicate the results of those effort in real time.

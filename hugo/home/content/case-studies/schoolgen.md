School-gen, a division of Genesis Energy, has a mission to boost STEM (Science, technology, Engineering and Math) curriculum across NZ schools from primary to college level. School-gen accomplishes this by installing solar panels on schools and providing them with interactive web dashboards that alolows teachers and student to understand energy flows.

One of the challenges School-gen had was supporting a heterogeneous set of solar PV assets. Many of the schools have had solar panels added over time, with different brands of hardware.  Often each manufacturer provides their own way of charting the performance of their systems, but those systems are closed and inflexible. Another challenge faced by School-gen was being able to simultaneously track each school's power generation _and_ consumption.  SolarNetwork was a good fit for School-gen as it met these requirements and provided a low-cost, customizable, flexible, and solid platform for their changing monitoring and visualization needs.

The images below are screen shots of the interactive visualization used at [one School-gen school](http://www.schoolgen.co.nz/schoolgen-schools/otonga-primary-30-kw). Solar energy generation data is collected from the _6_ solar power inverters that make up the system, as well as a power meter to measure the energy consumed from the electricity grid. Energy generated by the solar panels shows up as yellow bars going _up_ from the horizontal axis, while energy consumed from the grid shows up as orange bars going _down_. Sometimes the school actually generates more energy than it needs, and when that happens the excess energy is exported onto the grid, making the school an _energy producer_! Exported energy shows up on the chart as orange bars going _up_ from the horizontal axis.

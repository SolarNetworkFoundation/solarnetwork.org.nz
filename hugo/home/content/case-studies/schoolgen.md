School-gen, a division of Genesis Energy, has a mission to boost STEM (Science, technology, Engineering and Math) curriculum across NZ schools from primary to college level. School-gen accomplishes this by installing solar PV systems on schools, and providing them with interactive web dashboards that alolows teachers and student to understand energy flows.

One of the challenges Schoolgen has is supporting a heterogeneous set of solar PV assets, and being able to show the generation in the same visualisation as the school's consumption.  many of the schools have had solar PV systems added over tiem, with string and microinverter system intermixed often on the same buildings.  While each inverter manufacturer provides a way of charting raw generation performance, those systems are closed and inflexible.

Breaking the proprietary silos that each inverter manufacturer bundles with each system, SolarNetwork was the natural choice for School-gen as it met their requirements for a low-cost, customizable, flexible and super solid solution for advanced monitroing and display.

Back in 2008, two dads watched their girls play, started chatting, and found they had some things in common. Both were U.S. expats living in New Zealand and both had a strong interest in using technology for environmental purposes. The idea of an open, public infrastructure that used the internet to bridge renewable energy data streams, regardless of the hardware being used to produce the energy, started to swirl in their minds.

The two gathered a couple of solar panels, charge controllers, deep-cycle batteries, miniature PCs, and climbed their roofs to install the gear. Over the next weeks and months they wrote the code that would become the SolarNetwork platform. Today SolarNetwork is being used by schools, corporations, governments, solar integrators, and developers in numerous apps that display and control dynamic energy flows in novel ways. SolarNetwork and its founders have been recognized by awards and invitations to conferences and brainstorming sessions across the world: from the Asian Development Bank to the White House.

SolarNetwork Foundation was established in 2017 to serve as a curator and promoter of the open codebase and data-driven process that comprise the SolarNetwork platform.  The Foundation's work is guided by our belief in:

 1. open source computing
 1. data-driven methodology
 1. open access to data

We celebrate the innovations emerging from the community of developers, enthusiasts, and business leaders who share these values.

Our mission is to protect and preserve the environment by supporting energy education, and to use technology to engage people for the purposes of energy awareness, conservation, and the uptake of renewable energy sources.

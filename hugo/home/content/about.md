        <p>Matt Magoffin‚Äôs  work with SolarNetwork Foundation is an expression of his deeply-held commitment to environmental issues, and his desire to provide useful, flexible, open-access tools to address social and ecological problems. He retains a sense of delight at the possibilities for play and experimentation which technology offers after more than twenty years experience architecting and developing enterprise-level applications, both in New Zealand and in the United States.</p>
        <p>Matt lives in Wellington with his partner, two children, and large shaggy dog. üêæ</p>

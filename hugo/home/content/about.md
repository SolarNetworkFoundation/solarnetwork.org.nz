<p class="uk-text-lead">SNF started on a playground in Auckland.</p>

Back in 2008, two girls were playing at the Tole Street playground in Ponsonby, Auckland. Their dads looked on as the girls climbed the jungle gym, swung on the monkey bars and slid down the slides. After a bit the dads got to chatting, and it turned out they had some things in common. Both were U.S. expats living in New Zealand and both had a strong interest in using technology for environmental purposes. Matt was an enterprise developer with a keen interest in environmental issues. John had just started a masters programme at the University of Auckland school of Electrical and Computer Engineering focused on solar power data management. The idea ofan open, public infrastructure that used the internet to bridge renewable energy data streams, regardless of the hardware being used to produce the energy, started to swirl in their minds.

The two gathered a couple of solar panels, charge controllers, deep-cycle batteries, miniature PCs, and climbed their roofs to install the gear. A new online repository held the first code to acquire, persist, and centralise the storage of up to the minute, raw solar data. These were called SolarNodes (as per graph theory) and the repository was called SolarNet.  Since then, the software has grown to support a variety of solar inverters, charge controllers, industrial switches, PLCS, weather and spot-price web services. SolarNetwork has been used by schools, large corporates, governments in the Pacific, solar integrators and and app developers to produce dashboards and apps to display and control dynamic energy flows. As an innovation platform, the SolarNetwork platform has been highlighted by awards and invitations to conferences and brainstorming sessions across the world from the Asian Developement Bank to the White House.

SolarNetwork Foundation commenced in 2017 to serve as a curator of the open codebase and promoter of the data-driven process that encompass the SolarNetwork platform. Our mission is to help illustrate solutions and encourage new ideas on energy management with this platform, and celebrate the innovation that is appearing from the community of developers, enthusiasts, and business leaders recognizing the value in this philosophy.

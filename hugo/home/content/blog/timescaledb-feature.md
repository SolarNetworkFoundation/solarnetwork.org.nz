SolarNetwork has relied on the [TimescaleDB][tsdb] extension for the PostgreSQL database for many
years. Timescale (the company) asked us if we'd like to share our story with them, which has
resulted in a [post in their blog][tsblog].

We also gave a brief presentation at the April 2020 [DataPub][datapub] meetup, where we gave a
little overview of SolarNetwork and how TimescaleDB has helped the SolarNetwork project.

Thanks to the ever friendly and encouraging team @ Timescale for taking an interest in SolarNetwork!

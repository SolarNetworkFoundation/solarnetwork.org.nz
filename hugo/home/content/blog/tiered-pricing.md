As a non-profit entity, SolarNetwork Foundation always strives to keep the costs of running the
SolarNetwork platform as low as possible and to offer subscriptions at a fair and reasonable amount
based directly on those costs. SolarNetwork's subscriber base is growing, and those subscribers are
monitoring an ever-increasing amount of renewable energy assets as they expand and grow themselves.

We are very excited to announce a new tiered subscription price structure that results in
significant cost savings for subscribers capturing large volumes of data. Now the overall cost of
using SolarNetwork reduces the more you use it.

Here are the new pricing tiers for the subscriptions SolarNetwork Foundation offers. Based on the
current level of data flowing through SolarNetwork, this new tiered pricing model will provide more
than _50% cost savings_ for SolarNetwork subscribers overall!

|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|

| Properties posted | $9 / million       | $6 / million       | $4 / million       | $2 / million       |
| Datum queried     | $2 / million       | $1 / million       | $0.50 / million    | $0.20 / million    |
| Datum stored      | $0.40 / million    | $0.20 / million    | $0.05 / million    | $0.006 / million   |

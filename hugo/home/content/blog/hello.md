The SolarNetwork Foundation is pleased to launch this website, which has been [a long time](/about.html) in the making and long overdue. We're pretty excited about getting this charity off the ground and trying to help as many folks as possible in the process. We've already worked with a lot of great people and organisations, doing amazing work in all sorts of renewable energy and sustainability areas. We can't wait to meet more, and hopefully work together to help make Earth great again.

Thanks for checking out our new digs, and we look forward to posting more entries in the future!
